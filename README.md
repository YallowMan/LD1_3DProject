# ROLL A BALL PROJECT

## How to Play
### In this slightly Sonic themed roll a ball you can use either the arrow keys or WASD keys to move.
### You have to collect the yellow pickups, think of them as rings to beat the level. The green pickups are speed boosts that last for about a 
### second each time you pick it up. There is a level where a stalker ball "Shadow" follows you around and bumps you all over the place. Be Warned!
