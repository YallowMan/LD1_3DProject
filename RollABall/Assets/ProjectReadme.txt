***Project modifications were made to extend the functionality in a playable level that is easier for level design students to work with.***
This includes:
- Reorganizing existing scripts into a more rigid structure to improve separation of responsibilities and create a game loop.
- Adding a timer, game states and improving the reusability of UI objects.

How to play:
1) Use WASD controls to move the character (ball).
2) Collect all the cubes before the timer reaches 20.

***This project is setup to facilitate individual level creation and focus on learning how to develop levels using level design tools and techniques within Unity.***
***This project is not suitable for developing a full game. It's been developed as a demonstration and level design tool to assist learning.***
***Code has been organized and written to support level designers, as a tool, not a formal game system.***
